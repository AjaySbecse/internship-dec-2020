				Flutter is a framework to to build the mobile application and the web application. It follow the single code base concept. We don't need to code a application for android and for IOs separately. It automatically create application for both platform. It also has a functionality of hot reloading concept which allow us to see the desired output based on the code we change spontaneously. 
				As I mentioned in the First point It also work for the Web application. By learning a single concept we can able to develop our application to all the leading platform.

				Mobile app development companies are looking for opportunities to develop applications within a compact sequence and with a bounded estimate and when they have an introduction to flutter, the SDK is available and originated as a source developer to traverse and create compelling tracking applications throughout. It is the rationalization for apps and interfaces constructed with flutter. Flutter frames from a single codebase, satisfy the features of cross-platform app development, compile undeviatingly to the native arm code. Flutter Uses the GPU and obtain the platform APIs and services. Native mobile app development for iOS or Android always demands two glance different tech stacks that happen in two distinct teams and higher costs.

				Programmers who previously grasp the coding languages like Java, JavaScript, Kotlin, C#, or Swift can spring programming in Dart almost immediately. 

				Dart is a programming language that was originally used inside at Google to build web, server, and mobile applications. Dart has been encompassing since 2011, but it didn’t get any recognition outside of Google. Dart compiles the source code likewise to other programming languages like JavaScript, but the standalone Dart SDK is transmitted with a Dart VM. Unlike other programming languages, Dart has its individual package administrator called Pub. Dart introduced receiving more recognition in 2017 when Google officially announced Flutter beta for cross-platform mobile app development which was the first introduction to flutter and developers. Since then, the demand for Dart has drastically enhanced. At the moment, mobile application developers are enthusiastic to embrace Flutter, but they have to acquire Dart to get commenced.

				Dart is an infinite motive for developers why they prefer Flutter. While Dart compiled to JavaScript, Flutter doesn’t use this characteristic. Flutter Dart is compiled to native binary code.
